# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression for predicting breast cancer using a dataset containing various attributes related to breast cancer characteristics. The model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation techniques.

## Repository Name
**Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Logistic-Regression**

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict whether a given breast cancer sample is malignant or benign using machine learning. The dataset includes features such as cell size, shape, and other characteristics, which are used to train a logistic regression model. 

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `breast_cancer.csv`, which contains information on various characteristics of breast cancer samples. It is divided into features and the target label (`malignant` or `benign`).

## Results

- The confusion matrix shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
- The accuracy score provides a measure of the overall performance.
- Cross-validation results show the consistency and variance of the model across different subsets of the training data.
